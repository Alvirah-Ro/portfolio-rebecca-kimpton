                            Hi, I'm Rebecca,<br />
                            and I'm excited to begin
                            a new career <br />

                        I have a background in music, performing the oboe and English horn for several years with the
                        Waterloo-Cedar Falls Symphony Orchestra.
                        I recently decided to change careers and embarked on my new journey to become a software developer.
                        Along the way, I earned an IBM certificate in full-stack software development.
                        I am excited to use my creative, artistic inclinations to design and develop attractive, functional apps and webpages.
